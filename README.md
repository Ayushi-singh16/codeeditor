Project Description:
During my internship at CodTech IT Private Limited, I worked on a Collaborative Code Editor, a full-stack web application designed for real-time collaborative coding. The project enables multiple users to edit code simultaneously on a shared document, with instant updates visible to all participants.

The frontend was developed using React.js and CodeMirror, providing a rich code editing experience with syntax highlighting and line numbers. The backend used Node.js with Express and Socket.IO for real-time communication. MongoDB was used for persistent storage of code documents, ensuring that users can load and save their work across sessions.

The application emphasizes real-time collaboration, database integration, and full-stack development practices. Users can write, edit, and sync code using a simple interface, while the backend handles broadcasting changes to all connected clients.

This internship helped me enhance my skills in React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and WebSocket-based real-time applications, while gaining hands-on experience in developing interactive, data-driven full-stack applications. The project also demonstrates the ability to work under guidance, follow best coding practices, and deliver a functional solution within the one-month internship duration.
